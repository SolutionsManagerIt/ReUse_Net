## Welcome to ReUse.Net


An example of common [ReUse concept](https://github.com/SolutionsManagerIt/ReUse) with widely used .NET languages family.

Well designed common collaborative code framework with simple main principles : heavy focus on typical code reuse, ultra minimalistic, lightweight and highly efficient, extendable.

Since most recent programming languages open source codes are not well designed, we decided to make a Well designed common collaborative code frameworks with simple main principles :

- heavy focus on typical code reuse
- designed to be a common code library
- ultra minimalistic standard names
- well defined comments
- allow to use extensions based on core framework
- lightweight and highly efficient
- standard common languages base types support with extensions to custom language types
